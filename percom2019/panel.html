<h1>Is Privacy Regulation Slowing Down or Enabling the Wide Adoption of Pervasive Systems?</h1>


<dl>

<p>In the last years we have witnessed large scale data privacy violations mostly due to security issues or to unauthorised use and communication of personal data. Among many events, millions of Yahoo e-mail accounts and Facebook private profiles were violated. Mobile and pervasive technology and services have a role in this scenario, since they introduce new devices with possible hardware and software security holes, new communication protocols, new types of personal data, and a new scale for the amount of data being collected. Location data of individuals collected through mobile devices is a natural example, and video imaging and speech collected in our homes by smart appliances and toys is another.</p>

<p>Solicited by large scale privacy violations and public concern amplified by the news, regulators in most countries have taken action in revising legal obligations related to data privacy. The EU has approved in 2016 the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that is being enforced since May 2018, Japan has taken similar steps with the amended Act on the Protection of Personal Information, the US has a regulation fragmented by sector and state, but for example California passed in June 2018 a new data privacy law that has a very GDPR feel. </p>

<p>As a consequence, industry has been forced to invest a significant amount of money and resources in making their systems and products compliant to the regulation and in changing the design, production and test processes of their products. This will inevitably have an impact on the type of services that will be offered, on their cost, and on the timing of their appearance on the market. While the value of investing in security is usually well understood, investing in privacy is often seen only as a cost, specially by small and medium size companies.</p>

<p>Considering user needs, sociological studies report that users are indeed very concerned about their digital personal data being misused. On the other hand economic studies show that users are ready to provide consent without looking closely at the terms, based on minimal reward in terms of money or service. 
Leveraging on this fact, on the challenge of implementing effective privacy protection techniques, and on the argument that the massive exchange and use of digital personal data is a natural evolution of our social norms, there is a shared opinion against a strict privacy regulation in favor of a more rapid evolution and time to market of pervasive systems.</p>

<p>There are of course different opinions in favor of the regulation. Among them a) the role of institutions in protecting individuals, especially when they are unaware of potential threats to their basic rights; b) the availability of privacy enhancing technology resulting from decades of research; and c) the fact that the compliance of the products should convince a large number of potential users that are now worried about their privacy to adopt the technology and use the services.</p>

<p>The panel at PerCom is the opportunity to discuss these issues among researchers that design the mobile and pervasive systems possibly going to the market in the near future. The panelists include experts in privacy enhancing technologies applied to mobile and pervasive systems as well as researchers with experience in designing and deploying pervasive systems.
