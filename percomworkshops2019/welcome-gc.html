<h1 >Welcome Message form the General Chairs</h1>
<p>On behalf of the PerCom Organizing Committee, we are pleased to present the PerCom 2019 workshop proceedings, which contains the technical papers of the affiliated events. This is the sixteenth year of affiliated events at PerCom. Following the rich tradition of the conference series, these events include thematic Workshops, a Work-in-Progress session, a PhD Forum and technical Demonstrations. They provide a valuable forum for discussing ideas in a broad range of topics related to the pervasive computing and communications. The workshops also provide a platform for researchers, students, and practitioners to discuss their ideas informally and establish collaborations.
In 2019, the PerCom Workshop chairs selected nine new and thirteen long-standing workshops whose popularity and impact on the field are well established. In particular, the 2019 program includes the following new workshops:</p>
<ul>
<li>BiRD: International Workshop on Behavior analysis and Recognition for knowledge Discovery</li>
<li>MUSICAL: International Workshop on Mobile Ubiquitous Systems, Infrastructures, Communications and AppLications </li>
<li>PerDial: The 1st International Workshop on Pervasive Computing and Spoken Dialogue Systems </li>
<li>PerPersuasion: 1st International Workshop on Pervasive Persuasive System for Behavior Change </li>
<li>PerVehicle: 1st International Workshop on Pervasive Computing for Vehicular System</li>
<li>SPT-IoT: The Third Workshop on Security, Privacy and Trust in the Internet of Things</li>
<li>UNAGI: Workshop on UNmanned aerial vehicle Applications in the Smart City: from Guidance technology to enhanced system Interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to extend special thanks to the workshops chairs, Takahiro Hara (Osaka University, Japan), Delphine Reinhardt (University of Göttingen, Germany) and Nirmalya Roy (University of Maryland Baltimore County, USA) for their efforts in selecting the workshops and liaising with the workshop organizers, the publication chairs and the local organizing committee. We also acknowledge the individual workshop chairs for their contributions.</p>
<p>This volume also contains papers from the Work-in-Progress (WiP) session, and extended abstracts from the PhD Forum and the Technical Demonstrations. The WiPs session, organized by Takuya Maekawa (Osaka University, Japan) and Peizhao Hu (Rochester Institute of Technology, USA) provides a forum for the presentation of novel and promising research ideas on different aspects of pervasive computing and communications. The PhD forum co-chaired by Jin Nakazawa (Keio University, Japan) and Vana Kalogeraki (Athens University of Economics and Business, Greece) is an opportunity for PhD students to present and receive feedback on their ongoing dissertation work. The Demonstrations program co-chaired by Susumu Ishihara (Shizuoka University, Japan) and Salil Kanhere (The University of New South Wales, Australia) provides an opportunity for researchers and engineers to present their latest working prototypes to the PerCom community.</p>
<p>Damith Ranasinghe (The University of Adelaide, Australia) and Matthäus Wander (University of Duisburg-Essen, Germany) have done an outstanding job of managing the publication of the workshop proceedings.</p>
<p>Finally, we thank the PerCom community for their continued support of this premier conference. We hope you enjoy the PerCom affiliated events and will be inspired by the technical content!</p>
