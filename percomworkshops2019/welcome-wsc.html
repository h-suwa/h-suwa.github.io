<p>It is our pleasure to introduce the PerCom 2019 workshop program. This year's twenty two PerCom workshops feature a wide range of topics in various emerging research areas in the field of pervasive computing. As the integral part of the main conference, the purpose of the workshops is to provide a less formal and more focused forum where novel and stimulating ideas and experiences are shared among researchers both from industry and academia, on all the topics of interest for the pervasive computing community. The number and quality of the workshops contribute to making PerCom one of the premiere fora in pervasive computing.</p>
<p>Each individual workshop was managed independently by its organizers. We worked closely with them to make sure that each workshop provides a high-quality program with significant room for discussion and lots of opportunities for lively interaction. We would like to thank all the workshops organizers for their outstanding job on soliciting submissions from all over the world. We would also like to thank the numerous program committee members and reviewers for their efforts in carrying out a rigorous peer review process. Finally, we would like to congratulate all the authors of the accepted papers.</p>
<p>We hope you will enjoy the workshop program that complements this year's PerCom in Kyoto.</p>
