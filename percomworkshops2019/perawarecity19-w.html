<h1 >Welcome Message from the General Chairs</h1>
<p>Welcome to the 4th IEEE International Workshop on Pervasive Context-Aware Smart Cities and Intelligent Transport Systems (PerAwareCity) workshop, held in conjunction with the IEEE Percom 2019 in Kyoto, Japan.</p>
<p>This workshop focuses on bringing together researchers and practitioners working on systems and applications in the Smart City domain. Since nearly 60% of the world population lives in urban areas, the majority of the planet's resources are consumed in cities. As a consequence, applications targeting urban areas can positively impact a significant fraction of the population. Context-aware applications in the smart city range from transportation, energy, safety to low-carbon living.</p>
<p>The ongoing advances in Pervasive Computing and Wireless Communication technology have delivered interesting hardware platforms that are suitable for city-scale infrastructure deployments and networking. Also, novel techniques using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are now available for intelligent (real time) analytics and decision making by processing streaming sensor data collected from the surrounding environment. Fleets of smart cars can be distributed computational and sensing resource along with increasingly large crowds of people equipped with sensor-rich mobile and wearable devices, which can facilitate wide-scale crowd-sensing and crowd-sourcing.</p>
<p>We are pleased to notify that, this year we received 16 submitted papers with full manuscripts and we received a total of 65 reviews for them from the TPC members averaging ~ 4 reviews per paper. The review process was intensive to maintain sufficient quality and we finally decided to accept only 50% of the papers weighted by the reviewer expertise and review scores. The accepted papers shall have significant contribution in city-scale smart system development. We shall also have an interesting Keynote Speech by Prof. Jiannong Cao from the Department of Computing, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University. This year, we plan to introduce an open discussion forum for identifying novel issues and challenges associated with Pervasive Context-Aware Smart Cities and Intelligent Transport Systems. </p>
<p>The authors of the accepted papers have addressed various challenges to enable pervasive context-aware smart cities. </p>
<p>Mr. Casper Van Gheluwe, et al., have discussed Error Sources in the Analysis of Crowdsourced Spatial Tracking Data. The procedure presented by the authors ensures that the data analytics and resulting changes in policy are sufficiently substantiated by credible and reliable information. Mr. Amac M. Guvensan, et al., have proposed A Novel Input Set for LSTM based Transport Mode Detection. The frame-based novel input set utilizes time-domain and frequency-domain features captured through smartphone sensors. Tim Bauer, et al., have carried out A Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis of Real Time Traffic Information Providers. The results indicate not only that the range of services varies widely among traffic information providers but also the travel time predictions diverge. A wonderful survey on Accessibility of Our Personal Data in the Connected World has been done by Mr. Manh Nguyen, et al. This research also presents a more accessible data platform where users can store and manage their data with other stakeholders in an access-controlled manner. Dr. Kei Hiroi and the team have made a significant Case Study of Japan floods in 2018 in their Flood Area Estimation using Personal Location Data paper. The proposed method has proved to estimate the anomaly occurrence correctly in the area where inundation actually occurred. Mr. Stefan Herrnleben, et al., have experimented Towards Adaptive Car-to-Cloud Communication. The authors surveyed Car-to-Cloud communication applications to identify varying requirements and challenges. A Blockchain-based Architecture for Integrated Smart Parking Systems has been proposed by Mr. Sabbir Ahmed, et al. The proposed system brings multiple parking service providers together under a unified platform aiming to provide one-stop parking information services to the commuters in a smart city. Finally, Dr. Sophie Naylor and team carried out a Vehicle Availability Profiling from Diverse Data Sources. This paper covers the problem definition and development of a system to classify vehicle user driving patterns.</p>
<p>We welcome every attendee to the workshop and urge you to actively participate in all the networking and discussions for advancing smart city research and development. </p>
